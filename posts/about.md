we do stuff on the internet.
we're creative, we think. we think inside and outside the box.

sometimes the box doesn't even exist, purely theoretical. who knows, it's a box, it doesn't really exist - it only exists in your mind; you imagined the box.

it was never there. never existed.

maybe it will some day. or maybe it does. maybe i'm lying, it could be. we don't really know.
